  <DisplayText>[Tuna] Hey ${currentDog}! I baked a cake today and it came out great, aren't you proud of me? It's on the stove now and I can't wait to eat it later! But that cake is not for dogs, got it? It's for human palates only. That means it shouldn't be in or near your mouth. Are we clear?</DisplayText>
